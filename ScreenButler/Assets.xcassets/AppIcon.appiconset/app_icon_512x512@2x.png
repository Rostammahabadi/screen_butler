This is a placeholder file. Please replace with an actual 1024x1024 PNG image.

For TestFlight validation, you'll need to create actual PNG files with the correct dimensions and place them in this directory.

For proper app icon creation:
1. Design a square icon at 1024x1024 pixels
2. Export versions at 512x512 (app_icon_512x512.png) and 1024x1024 (app_icon_512x512@2x.png)
3. Place both files in the AppIcon.appiconset directory
4. Use Xcode's built-in asset catalog to generate all required sizes
